# Celebal Data Science Internship
As a Data Science Intern at Celebal Technologies, I will work on real-world industry projects involving advanced analytics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. I will:

Collaborate with teams to understand business problems and contribute to designing predictive models.

Use Python (with libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.

Assist in building interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize KPIs and business insights.

Gain hands-on experience with cloud services (such as Azure or AWS) while developing scalable data pipelines and solutions.

Participate in agile development practices, including sprint planning, code reviews, and client presentations.

This internship will enhance my technical expertise in ML workflows, cloud tools, and data visualization, while also strengthening my problem-solving and collaborative skills in a professional environment.
