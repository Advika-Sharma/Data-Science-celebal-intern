## 🌐 What is **SQL Server**?

**Microsoft SQL Server** is a **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** built by Microsoft. It is used to **store, retrieve, and manipulate data** in relational format — i.e., in **tables with rows and columns**.

It supports **SQL (Structured Query Language)** as the standard language to communicate with the database. It’s widely used in industries to manage everything from small business data to enterprise-level applications.

## 🔧 Key Components of SQL Server

### 1. **SQL Server Database Engine**

* The **core service** for storing, processing, and securing data.
* Supports **transactions**, **concurrency**, **replication**, and **data integrity**.

### 2. **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**

* A GUI tool to manage your databases.
* You can:

  * Write and run SQL queries
  * Create/modify databases, tables, views
  * Monitor performance
  * Create and schedule backups

### 3. **T-SQL (Transact-SQL)**

* Microsoft's extension to standard SQL.
* Adds programming constructs like:

  * Variables
  * Loops
  * Error handling
  * Stored procedures and triggers

## 🗂️ Basic Structure of a SQL Server Database

* **Database** → Collection of related data

  * **Tables** → Store data in rows and columns
  * **Views** → Virtual tables based on queries
  * **Stored Procedures** → Precompiled queries
  * **Triggers** → Auto-run SQL on specific events
  * **Indexes** → Speed up search queries

## 🔤 Common SQL Commands in SQL Server

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

* `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`
* `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

* `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

### Data Control Language (DCL)

* `GRANT`, `REVOKE`

### Transaction Control

* `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`

## 🛠️ How You Interact with SQL Server

You can:

* Use **SSMS (GUI tool)** to write SQL queries
* Use **sqlcmd** from the command line
* Use **applications** (like Python, Power BI, or web apps) to connect and fetch data via connection strings

## 🔄 Real-Life Use Cases

* **E-commerce**: To store user data, orders, product inventory
* **Healthcare**: Patient records, lab data, appointments
* **Banking**: Transactions, customer profiles, logs
* **Analytics/BI**: Use with tools like Power BI to create dashboards

## 🧪 Sample SQL Query

```sql
-- Select all records from a table
SELECT * FROM Students;

-- Insert new student
INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (101, 'Advika', 22);

-- Update data
UPDATE Students SET Age = 23 WHERE ID = 101;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 101;
```

## 📌 Summary

SQL Server is:

* A robust, enterprise-grade database system
* Ideal for managing structured data securely
* Compatible with many front-end and backend apps
* Widely used in industries ranging from healthcare to banking to e-commerce
