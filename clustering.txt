## üìå **Clustering in Machine Learning**

### üîç What is Clustering?

* **Clustering** is an **unsupervised learning** technique where unlabeled data is grouped based on similarity.
* **Cluster**: Group of similar data points based on distance or density.

### üß† When to Use Clustering:

* No labeled data available.
* Feature engineering & pattern discovery.
* Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection).
* Applications: marketing segmentation, earthquake analysis, city planning, library classification.

## üß™ **Types of Clustering Algorithms (Based on Approach)**

| Approach               | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centroid-based**     | Data grouped by distance to centroids (e.g., K-Means)                      |
| **Density-based**      | Groups formed around dense regions (e.g., DBSCAN, OPTICS)                  |
| **Distribution-based** | Based on probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian Mixture)                |
| **Hierarchical**       | Tree-like structure (top-down or bottom-up), e.g., Agglomerative, Divisive |

## üßÆ **Top 8 Clustering Algorithms You Should Know**

### 1. **K-Means**

* **Type**: Centroid-based
* **Use**: Fast, simple clustering of small/medium datasets
* **Drawback**: Requires pre-defining `k`; poor with non-circular clusters
* **Scales poorly** on large data

### 2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**

* **Type**: Density-based
* **Use**: Arbitrary-shaped clusters, outlier detection
* **Parameters**: `eps`, `minPts`
* **Drawback**: Parameter sensitivity

### 3. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**

* **Type**: Distribution-based
* **Use**: Handles elliptical/complex-shaped clusters
* **Drawback**: Sensitive to initialization; assumes Gaussian distribution

### 4. **BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)**

* **Type**: Hierarchical-based
* **Use**: Efficient with **large datasets**
* **Approach**: Summarizes data ‚Üí then clusters
* **Drawback**: Only works with numeric data

### 5. **Affinity Propagation**

* **Type**: Message-passing-based
* **Use**: Doesn‚Äôt require pre-defining number of clusters
* **Drawback**: Can be slow, sensitive to damping and preference

### 6. **Mean-Shift**

* **Type**: Mode-seeking / hierarchical
* **Use**: Image segmentation, computer vision
* **Drawback**: Computationally expensive; doesn't scale well

### 7. **OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure)**

* **Type**: Density-based
* **Use**: Better than DBSCAN for variable density clusters
* **Drawback**: Slower than DBSCAN

### 8. **Agglomerative Clustering**

* **Type**: Hierarchical (bottom-up)
* **Use**: Builds dendrogram from leaf to root
* **Drawback**: Less efficient on large datasets

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Divisive Clustering** | Top-down approach, more accurate but computationally complex          |
| **Mini-Batch K-Means**  | Faster than K-Means on large datasets but less accurate               |
| **Spectral Clustering** | Uses graph theory; data as nodes and edges, works without assumptions |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Things to Watch Out For**

* **Scalability**: Many clustering algorithms are slow on large datasets.
* **Parameter Sensitivity**: Some require careful tuning (DBSCAN, GMM).
* **Data Type Compatibility**: Some (like BIRCH) require numeric data.
* **Cluster Shape**: K-means assumes circular clusters; GMM, DBSCAN handle arbitrary shapes.

## ‚úÖ **Clustering in Practice**

* Great for **exploring unknown data**.
* Often used in **unsupervised ‚Üí supervised pipelines** (e.g., using clusters as features).
* Helps uncover **hidden patterns and relationships**.
