### 🧠 **What is LangChain?**

**LangChain** is a **framework** for building applications powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It simplifies the full development lifecycle—from prototype to production—of **LLM-based apps** by offering tools, integrations, and orchestration capabilities.

---

### 🔧 **Core Goals:**

1. **Development:**
   Use open-source components and third-party tools to build LLM apps (e.g., LangGraph for stateful agents).
2. **Productionization:**
   Use **LangSmith** for inspecting, debugging, and evaluating applications.
3. **Deployment:**
   Turn apps into production-ready APIs and assistants using **LangGraph Platform**.

### 🧱 **Architecture Breakdown:**

| Component                | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **langchain-core**       | Base abstractions for chat models, embeddings, and memory.                               |
| **langchain**            | Chains, agents, and strategies for application design.                                   |
| **langchain-community**  | Community-maintained integrations.                                                       |
| **langgraph**            | Orchestration framework for **multi-actor, stateful LLM apps** (can be used standalone). |
| **Integration Packages** | e.g., `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`—for LLM providers.                       |

### 🚀 **Quick Setup Example (Google Gemini):**

```python
pip install -qU "langchain[google-genai]"

import getpass, os
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for Google Gemini: ")

from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
model = init_chat_model("gemini-2.0-flash", model_provider="google_genai")
model.invoke("Hello, world!")
```
