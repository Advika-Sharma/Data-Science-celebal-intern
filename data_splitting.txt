📘 **Data Splitting in Machine Learning**

### 📌 What is Data Splitting?

**Data Splitting** is the process of dividing a dataset into separate parts for training, validating, and testing a machine learning model.

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Ensures model generalization and reliable evaluation by preventing overfitting.

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

Data is typically split into:

1. **Training Set**

   * Used to teach the model patterns and relationships in data.
   * Must be **representative** and **unbiased**.
   * Usually makes up **60–80%** of the full dataset.

2. **Validation Set**

   * Used to **tune hyperparameters** and compare multiple model architectures.
   * Prevents using test data during model tuning.
   * Helps choose the **best model** before final evaluation.
   * Typically around **10–20%** of the dataset.

3. **Test Set**

   * Used **only once** after the final model is selected.
   * Measures the model's ability to generalize on **unseen data**.
   * Should be **kept separate** from training and validation.

### 📊 **Example Use Case**

**Problem**: Classifying gender based on weight and voice pitch

* **Train Set**: Model learns the relation between `weight`, `pitch`, and gender.
* **Validation Set**: Compare multiple decision trees with different depths/splits.
* **Test Set**: Check final model accuracy before deployment.

---

### ✅ **Best Practices**

* Always **split randomly** to avoid bias.
* Ensure **class balance** in all subsets (especially in classification tasks).
* Don’t use test data during training or validation.
* If data is limited, use **cross-validation** to simulate validation performance.

### 📌 **Summary Takeaways**

* Data splitting is a **critical step** in the ML pipeline.
* Split into **train**, **validation**, and **test** sets.
* Training data helps **learn**, validation helps **tune**, and test helps **evaluate**.
* Validation prevents overfitting; test ensures **real-world performance**.
* Use **test set only once** for unbiased final evaluation.
