## 🔍 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where algorithms learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

It’s widely used in:

* Image/speech recognition
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Recommendation systems
* Fraud detection
* Autonomous vehicles
* Robotics

## 📌 Why is Machine Learning Needed?

* Learns from **past data** to improve performance over time
* Useful in handling **large data volumes**, complex decisions, and **dynamic environments**

**Applications**:

* **Predictive modeling** (e.g., sales forecasting)
* **NLP** (e.g., chatbots, voice assistants)
* **Computer Vision** (e.g., face recognition, self-driving cars)
* **Fraud Detection**
* **Personalized Recommendations**

## ⚙️ How ML Algorithms Work

1. **Data Collection** – Gather relevant data
2. **Preprocessing** – Clean, normalize, and split (train/test)
3. **Model Selection** – Choose a model type (e.g., decision tree, SVM, neural net)
4. **Training** – Model learns from training data
5. **Evaluation** – Use metrics like accuracy, MSE to check performance
6. **Tuning** – Adjust hyperparameters for optimal performance
7. **Prediction** – Use model for real-world inference
